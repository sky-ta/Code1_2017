The game came out as a personal challenge to create a flappy bird like game within 3 weeks of work and to bring it to as many platforms as possible, without using any commercial software. All 8-bit graphics have been created from scratch using GIMP. All audio effects have been recorded using femitracker. The code is written in Java and uses libgdx, an open-source game engine. The port to iOS was done using RoboVM.
